# News-group-classification-NLP-project
Natural Language Processing project that makes classification to the types of the news and makes visualization to the dataset. Using python, sklearn, seaborn, and matplotlib.

#### How to run
* Unrar "svm_model.rar" and "test_data.rar" files.
* Install sklearn, seaborn, nltk, pandas, numpy, and matplotlib libraries.
* main.py file reads the data and split it into training set and testing set and then it train it using 3 models "logistic regression", "svm", and "naive bayes", then it test it and save the models and the data after split and the score (all these files saved before and exists in the project files).
* plots_and_testing.py file is responsible for graphs and testing, this file loads the models which saved before and also loads the testing data which saved before and thier results, then it test these data again for each model, then it draw graphs to show the difference between the three models and visualize the data set itself.
